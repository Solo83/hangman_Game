Hangman is a guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number (6) of guesses.
The idea for the project was taken from [here](https://github.com/zhukovsd/java-backend-learning-course/blob/main/Projects/Hangman/index.md).
